# 🎨 Prism Studio

## 📱 About the project

Prism Studio is an e-commerce project for art supplies that I'm building to improve my React Native skills and create something cool! The idea is to make a simple and fun platform where artists can browse and buy art materials.

For the backend, I'm using my [MarketCore API](https://github.com/vinifen/marketcore-api) project, which is a standard e-commerce API. Now I'm focusing on building the React Native project that will connect to this API.

### 🔧 Core Functionalities

- [ ] User authentication and registration
- [ ] Product catalog browsing with categories
- [ ] Shopping cart management
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Order logic
- [ ] Product search functionality

## 🖼️ Screen Prototypes

I've created some basic prototypes for Prism Studio using Figma. These include the main screens and user flows for the core features of the project.

## 🗄️ Database Modeling

This is the database schema from my MarketCore API backend that Prism Studio will be using. It's a standard e-commerce database with all the necessary tables for products, users, orders, and cart management.
